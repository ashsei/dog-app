## Approach
Began with simple wireframe, from which I was able to determine functionality needed. Produced a rough plan of what functionality to implement, in which order, to ensure dependent functionality was created after nessesary functionality was implemented. Focused on functionality and HTML design together, saving CSS styling for last once all functionality was implemented to my liking. 
    
For each segment of functionality I broke functions down to smallest code chunks possible implementing each as I ensured the previous segments were correctly implemented.

## Technologies Used
    JavaScript, jQuery, API Call using Axios, HTML, CSS, Google Font Integration, Github, Sticky Nav, Game Logic
    
## Known Bugs / Unsolved Problems

    Randomized answer choices do not alway fill out full dropdown, due to Math.random not always picking 1 through 5 when assigning answer choices.
